## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  to run a code block with ease - avoid rewriting the same block of code over and over again

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword + optional function name + optional parameter(s) in parentheses + opening curly brace + code block + closing curly brace

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  function name followed by ()

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are more like placeholders that we use when we define a function whereas an argument is what we pass through a function when we call it

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Act as placeholders until we pass an argument through it
